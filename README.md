# Geodetic Survey Course: Practice Projects

This repository contains practice projects developed for the **Geodetic Survey** course at the **University of Isfahan**, where I completed my bachelor's degree in Geomatics Engineering. These projects were created as hands-on exercises to help deepen understanding of geodetic surveying principles and are intended for educational purposes rather than advanced applications.

## About Geodetic Surveying

Geodetic surveying is the science of accurately measuring and understanding the Earth’s geometric shape, orientation in space, and gravity field. This type of survey considers the Earth’s curvature, enabling precise measurement over long distances. For an introduction to geodetic surveying concepts, you can read more [here](https://agriculture.mo.gov/weights/landsurvey/geodsrvy.php#:~:text=A%20geodetic%20survey%20determines%20the,and%20curvature%20of%20the%20earth.).
