# Geodetic Survey Project: Ellipse Pedal Curve

This repository contains a project developed for the **Geodetic Survey** course at the **University of Isfahan** in Fall 2017. The purpose of this project was to calculate and visualize the **ellipse pedal curve** for a 7-point geodetic network based on a nonlinear parametric model. The code was written in **Python 2.7** and is designed for educational purposes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to plot the ellipse pedal curve for each of the seven points in the geodetic network using two different modes:

- **Relative Mode**: Draws each ellipse pedal curve relative to a selected point in the network.
- **Absolute Mode**: Draws each ellipse pedal curve in absolute coordinates.

### About Ellipse Pedal Curves

An ellipse pedal curve is created by projecting each point in a geodetic network along a fixed direction relative to other points. In this project, the ellipse pedal curves for each of the seven points are computed and displayed in both **Relative** and **Absolute** modes.

## How to Use

1. **Select Drawing Mode**: Choose between **Relative** and **Absolute** modes to visualize the ellipse pedal curves accordingly.
2. **View Results**: The resulting plots display the pedal curves based on the userâ€™s choice of mode.

## Demonstration

Here are the example demonstrations of the ellipse pedal curves generated by this code:

| Mode                  | Demo                                                                                  |

## Note

This project was created as a learning exercise for the Geodetic Survey course. The code and approach used are not optimized for advanced applications but serve as an introductory tool to understand geodetic calculations and visualization techniques.
